# Arduino-PIR-sensor
The aim of this paper is to design and implement a system that generates a number on cubes using two sensor movements based on the Arduino NANO platform. PIR motion sensors HC-SR501 were used as motion sensors. At the moment when the first PIR sensor detects the movement, a timer that counts time is activated until another PIR sensor detects the movement. When the timer stops, we will get a time interval of activation of the sensors, based on which we calculate the speed of the object (hand) passing through the sensor. Based on the integer value of the velocity we divide by module 6 (speed% 6), we generate a number on the cube. The generated number is displayed on the application.
